    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome the OGC Testbed 16 DAPA evaluation workshop. With this Jupyter Notebook we (EOX IT Services and the German Aerospace Center - DLR) would like to provide you some introduction material, links to Jupyter Notebooks, and a documentation about our API definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our DAPA service endpoint is based on the EuroDataCube environment, which allows us to provide acess to a wide range of datasets: \n",
    "- Sentinel-1 GRD\n",
    "- Sentinel-2 L1C and L2A\n",
    "- Sentinel-3 OLCI and SLSTR\n",
    "- Sentinel-5P L2\n",
    "- Landsat-8 L1C (ESA archive)\n",
    "- MODIS\n",
    "- DEM\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see the Jupyter Notebooks for working examples. You can also use the DAPA service endpoint from your own environment (e.g., local computer, server). But please make sure, you do not publish the DAPA service endpoint URL (DAPA_URL) as this is connected to your personal account. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note:** Not any feature of the API is currently supported. The API might also not work with every dataset. It should work at least with Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM)."
